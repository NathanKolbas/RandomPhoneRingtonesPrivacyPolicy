# RandomPhoneRingtonesPrivacyPolicy

Simply Complex apps is very open about its privacy policy. Random Phone Ringtones requires some permissions to work properly or to even function at all. “android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE” is only used to know when a call has ended or if a call is missed. None of this data is saved or sent anywhere. Without this permission this app would not be possible. This is how the app knows when to randomize your phone ringtones. "android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" Is used to change your ringtone. It is not used to change anything else. Without this permission the app will be unable to change your ringtone. "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" Is used to add files to the app that will later be used to randomize your ringtones. If you have any questions about your privacy, or any concerns, please feel free to send an email to simplycomplexapps@gmail.com.
